NOTES

UNIX Domain Sockets
    - use socketpair
        - device is indecipherable letters/numbers
        - name is -> then the other end's device
    - using socketpair, multiple clients to one server
        - create socketpair, send the client fd to another process
            - the other process takes that fd and sends data
        - server
            - device is indecipherable letters/numbers
            - name is -> then the other end's device
        - child client
            - device is indecipherable letters/numbers
            - name is -> then the server's device
        - new client
            - device is indecipherable letters/numbers
            - name is -> then the server's device
        - both clients have the same device
        - if close the server first, new client name is -> (none)
    - listen using named sockets
        - waiting for connections
            - has one connection to the socket
            - device is indecipherable letters/numbers
            - name is the name of the socket
        - has a connection
            - server
                - has 2 connections to the socket
                    - one is socketFd, other is connection
                - device is indecipherable letters/numbers
                - name is the name of the socket
            - client
                - has one connection
                - device is indecipherable letters/numbers
                - name is the device of the clientFd of the server
        - has more than one connections
            - server
                - for each additional connection, another connection to named
                - device is indecipherable letters/numbers
                - name is the name of the socket
            - client
                - has one connection (looks same no matter number of clients)
                - device is indecipherable letters/numbers
                - name is the device of the clientFd of the server
    - abstract sockets
        - only a Linux thing
        - do not exist on Macs
