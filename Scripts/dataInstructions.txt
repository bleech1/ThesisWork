1. Download the zip file: bleech_thesis.zip
2. Open Terminal (click on the magnifying glass in the top right and type 
    terminal then press ENTER)
3. Type "cd ~/Downloads"
4. Type "unzip bleech_thesis.zip"
    If this gives you an error saying that it cannot find or open the file,
    then your computer probably unzipped the file when you downloaded it, so 
    continue to the next step.  If step 5 does not work, then try to re-download
    the zip file into the Downloads folder.
5. Type "cd bleech_thesis"
6. Type "mv * ~"
7. Type "cd ~"
8. Type "chmod +x mac-script.sh"
9. Type "sudo ./mac-script.sh"
10. Type in your password when prompted then press enter.  Your password will 
    not appear as you type but a 0 will appear after you press enter if it
    is correct.
11. Please leave terminal open until the program finishes.  It will print out 
    "The file has been uploaded correctly" when complete.  Until then, feel
    free to minimize terminal and use your computer normally, just please do
    not close terminal.
